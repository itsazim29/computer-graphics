# computer-graphics
A basic computer graphics program is designed to introduce fundamental concepts of visual representation on a computer screen. Such a program typically involves creating, manipulating, and displaying simple shapes like lines, circles, and rectangles using basic graphics libraries or APIs. For instance, using a language like Python with libraries such as turtle or pygame, one can draw geometric figures, apply colors, and create basic animations. This program serves as an educational tool, allowing users to understand coordinate systems, rendering processes, and event handling. By engaging with these elements, individuals can grasp essential principles of computer graphics, such as pixel manipulation, shape rendering, and interactive design, which form the foundation for more complex graphical applications and game development.
